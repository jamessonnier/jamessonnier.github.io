Would you like to check it out?

[[Yes-&gt;Time Machine]]
[[No-&gt;death]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Time Machine" tags="" position="503,431">You investigate the contraption. As you approach, lights on the contraption flicker on, illuminating the darkness with strange colors. It&#x27;s joints have oxidized and the paint is peeling off. There is a small hinged door on the side. Would you like to enter the machine?

[[No-&gt;Beginning]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="MachineInterior" tags="" position="503,581">You open the door, and as it swings out, it lets out a deep groan. You climb in, and the door slams shut behind you. As you look around, there are dusty knobs and buttons marked with unintelligible characters. There is a large red button in the center of the machine. Would you like to press it or attempt to leave?

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="ThePast" tags="" position="503,731">As you hit the button, the machine starts to vibrate. As it comes to life, you hear an unregistered frequency in your ears. Suddenly, the whirring comes to a rapid halt. The door creaks open and you step out. The chamber begins to fill with smoke. You can barely make out a door on the east side of the room. Would you like to approach it?

[[No-&gt;Smoke]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="LockedDoor" tags="" position="652,731">You reach for the door and attempt to open it. As you struggle to force it open, a loud alarm bell sounds. You hear loud footsteps outside the room. You hear a door open in the room and decide your best bet is to hit the red button.

[[Continue-&gt;ThePast]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="TheDoor" tags="" position="503,881">You head for the door on the east wall, fleeing from the smoke. You realise that it would be impossible to find your way back through the smoke, let alone survive it. Observing your surroundings, you find yourself in a dim corridor, lights flickering. You have two options.

[[Head South-&gt;Passworddoor]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Smoke" tags="" position="305,879">The smoke begins to escape the machine and billows, filling the room. You begin to worry and decide it would be best to leave. You stumble around in the now thick smoke and find a door against the west wall.
